arduinoModularTFTgauges
=======================

Modular (configurable via a config file) gauges for 1.8" and other common tft boards

Uses the wonderful OBD II arduino UART (and I2C) library from Stanley Huang: https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc/ArduinoOBD

I have forked his project and will add some extra PID's to it when I get the chance.
