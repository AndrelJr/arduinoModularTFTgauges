#obd sensors don't have pins associated with them

#page (aka mode) config
#as many pages as you want...the sketch will flip through until EOF and start again
#each sensor is configured per page
#obd sensors don't have pin assignments after them
#page types:
#	twobar - two horizontal bar graphs with text
#	onebar - one horizontal bar graph with text
#	cross - cross chart for accelerometer
#	round - 1 round gauge for one sensor
#sensor*text can be about 8 chars long on the one sensor pages...a little longer on the others (due to font size)
#There is a "fake" sensor...give it a pin number that is the max value you want...allows for easy testing.
